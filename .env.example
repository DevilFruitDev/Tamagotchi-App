# Tamagotchi AI Configuration
# This file is an example. API keys are configured in the app's Settings panel.
# You do NOT need to use this file - the app will prompt you to enter API keys in the UI.

# However, if you want to pre-configure API keys for development, you can:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Add your API key(s) below
# 3. Use environment variables in your code

# OPTION 1: Claude API (Anthropic)
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# REACT_APP_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here

# OPTION 2: OpenAI API (ChatGPT)
# Get your key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# NOTE: For security, API keys are stored in the browser's localStorage when configured
# via the Settings panel in the app. They are never sent to any server except the
# official Claude or OpenAI APIs.
